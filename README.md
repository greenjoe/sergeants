# Sergeants 

Sergeants is a framework for creating bots for the generals.io game. It consists of two packages:
* API, with the `GeneralsApi` class, that acts as a simple wrapper over the generals.io API and makes it easier to use it from Java. 
It doesn't offer any convenience methods and does only basic type transformations. 
* Framework which performs some data transformations and adds convenience methods 
to make writing code of bots and joining games with them as easy as possible. `Games` class can be used to start games when
`Bot` interface is implemented with appropriate logic.


# Common framework use case
Add maven dependency
```xml
       <dependency>
            <groupId>pl.joegreen</groupId>
            <artifactId>sergeants</artifactId>
            <version>0.4</version>
        </dependency>
```


implement the `Bot` interface 
```java

public class SimpleBorderExpandingBot implements Bot {

    private final Actions actions;

    public SimpleBorderExpandingBot(Actions actions) {
        this.actions = actions;
    }

    @Override
    public void onGameStateUpdate(GameState newGameState) {
        Optional<VisibleField> maybeFieldToAttack = newGameState.getVisibleFields().stream()
                .filter(this::canBeAttacked)
                .findFirst();

        maybeFieldToAttack.ifPresent(fieldToAttack -> {
            VisibleField attackFrom = fieldToAttack.getVisibleNeighbours().stream()
                    .filter(VisibleField::isOwnedByMe)
                    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(VisibleField::getArmy).reversed())
                    .findFirst().get();

            actions.move(attackFrom, fieldToAttack);
        });


    }

    private boolean canBeAttacked(VisibleField potentialTarget) {
        return !potentialTarget.isObstacle() && !potentialTarget.isOwnedByMyTeam() &&
                potentialTarget.getVisibleNeighbours().stream().anyMatch(
                        neighbour -> neighbour.isOwnedByMe() &&
                                neighbour.getArmy() > potentialTarget.getArmy() + 1
                );
    }


}


```
The bot above is very simple - it attacks nearby fields that can be conquered and does nothing if there are no such fields. 
You can see it in action in this [replay](http://bot.generals.io/replays/HgdiY9sKl) as `95eaec79-9`. 
The `GameState` class provides a lot of information so it should be easy to add more advanced logic. See the `Actions`
interface to find out what actions can be performed by the bot. An example of a more advanced bot - Java FFA, created using 
Sergeants, can be seen in action [here](http://bot.generals.io/replays/SxqqAIXte) and [here](http://bot.generals.io/replays/rxnjJFjKx).


Create a main class that plays the FFA game (this call uses random user identifier, change `UserConfiguration` to set up the player).

```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        Games.play(1, SimpleBorderExpandingBot::new,
                QueueConfiguration.freeForAll(false), UserConfiguration.random())
                .forEach(System.out::println);

    }
}
```
Run the class and wait for results. If constructor is used as a bot provider new instance of the bot will be created for every game.
`Games.playAsynchronously` method can be used to play multiple games (with different user identifiers) at the same time as it doesn't
block a calling thread.


# Low-level API

If the way framework works doesn't meet your needs you can still use low-level Java wrappers for the generals.io API. 
The following example shows how to set the username using the `GeneralsApi` class:

```java
        GeneralsApi generalsApi = GeneralsApi.create().onSetUsernameError(System.out::println);
        generalsApi.onConnected(() ->
                generalsApi.setUsername("userId", "userName"));
        generalsApi.connect();
```

# Versions & contributing

Please consider all versions below 1.0 "beta". Beta means that the project is new and wasn't tested in production too much,
so the probability of discovering bugs and usability issues is higher. It's possible that bigger architecture changes 
will be needed and the backward interface compatibility with bots written for previous versions may be broken. 

Well-described issues and pull requests are welcome. Please stick to the formatting conventions,
which are basically Intellij Idea defaults. Lombok plugin may be needed to compile the project in an IDE.
